2.It is android platform of iiitv institute which helps the students in finding important information without chaos.

The features of our android application:

1.It is hard to find every office order in mail ,this platform helps  students by providing all the office orders at same place.

2.As we have semester projects and summer design project,students often confuse on which area should he/she can do their project and what are the type of ideas.Our application solves the problem by providing the details of previous projects involved in courses.

3.As we have hectic schedule we cannot find time to enquire the administration regarding some important matters like scholarship ,fee receipt,etc .Our platform solves this problem with the help of Question and Answer Forum where student can ask the questions to the administration and his\her peers which would be open to everyone.This saves the time of student  and administration.

4.Every student is curious about the exam and interested in looking over the previous papers to know style and pattern of paper setting of instructor .Our platform solves the problem by sharing the previous paper of every exam(if faculty is agreed).Previous question papers are uploaded by application admin.

5.It is tough to carry the student kit every time with you.Our platform solves the problem by providing this kit in our application.

6.As our institute is in development phase,many visiting faculties visit our institute to teach us,so it is tough to make the time table in one sitting, due to this students get multiple mails of updating time table and it becomes chaotic for students .Our application solves the problem by uploading the updated time table in our application.

7.We have academic calender and holidays list window in our application.
